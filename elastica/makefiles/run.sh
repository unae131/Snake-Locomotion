		timoshenkobeam : Runs a cantilevered slender beam (clamped at the wall at one
		end, free at another) bending under the influence of a downward point force.
		We compare against analytical results using Timoshenko Beam theory.
	
		helicalbuckling : Runs the localized helical buckling benchmark which tests
		the mixed bending modes (two bending modes + twist mode). When an unstretchable
		rod is twisted at two ends, a characteristic instability arises which forms a
		localized helical shape at the center of the beam. There is an analytical solution
		(see Gazzola et. al, RSOS, 2018), which we compare against.
	
		snake : Runs an example of an snake, actuated by a continuum analytical bend-
		ing torque profile slithering on a plane-ground with anisotropic friction.
		This snake has been optimized for maximal forward speed.
	
		sphericaljoint : Runs an example of two rods connected by a spherical joint
		that allows for arbitrary rotations (see SphericalJoint.cpp)
	
		hingejoint : Runs an example of two rods connected by a hinge joint that
		allows for motion only along a constrained plane (see HingeJoint.cpp)
	
		fixedjoint : Runs an example of two rods connected by a fixed joint that
		does not allow any motion between the rods (see FixedJoint.cpp)
	
		pullingmuscle : Runs an example of two hanging vertical rods (connected to
		ground by a hinge) connected to each another's centers by a horizontal
		muscle. This muscle is actuated and pulls the rods together.
		(see PullingMuscle.cpp)
	
		elbow : Runs the injured elbow (50% Strength) with artificial muscles,
		as seen in Fig.7 in Supplementary Material.
	
		flagella : Runs the original biohybrid flagella design seen in Fig.2(a,b).
	
		walker : Runs the original biohybrid walker design at a frequency of 2 Hz,
		as seen in Fig.2(e,f). SLOW without parallelization.
	
		muscularsnake : Runs the muscular snake seen in Fig.3. SLOW without parallelization.
	
		wing : Runs the wing seen in Fig.4. EXTREMELY SLOW without parallelization.
